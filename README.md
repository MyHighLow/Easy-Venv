# Easy-Venv
## Concept
Easy-Venv is a pair of Powershell and CMD scripts to centralize the organization of python virtual environments. This allows for virtual environments to be accessed anywhere, and reused between multiple projects. This saves space on disk for commonly-used virtual environments.
